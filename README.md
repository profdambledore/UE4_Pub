## Concept

I created a simulation game where you manager your own bar, serving customers their orders as they sit down to have some drinks to relax.
The game features a Sims-esc level creation tool which allows you to place different pieces of furniture in the world if you can afford them.
Additionally, you can inspect certain furniture items (such as the Bar) to do different things with them.
In this version of the prototype, their are two different drink items that the player can serve to their customers - a beer and a cider.
The customer is always right, so when an order is created, only the correct item is served.
Most meshes in the game are from the SyntyStudios pack Shops.

When customers find their own table, they go to the bar to buy one of the available products.  When they have been served, they return to their table.<br />
The staff members man the bar until they receive an order to create a drink for a customer.  They proceed to serve the correct drink to the customer.<br />
Clicking on the bar will swap the UI to an inspect mode, allowing the player to re-fill it's inventory of product.  Each time an order is served, the item is taken out of this inventory.<br />

I plan to continue work on this project after my degree is finished.  There is a far range where I can take this project, including adding a full-scale building editor for example.
